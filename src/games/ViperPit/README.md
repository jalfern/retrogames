# VIPER PIT (#1096)

An original gritty one-on-one fighter in the spirit of the 1992 arcade shock
that made fighting games dangerous — original IP throughout: names, roster,
stages, moves, look. MODERN bar: articulated 3D fighters, dark atmospheric
pits, fog and hanging lamps. Sits on the shared fighting core from #1095 with
the #1096 options switched on.

## What makes it the gritty one, not IRON RING

- **A dedicated GUARD button** (`pad.bk`, O key / on-screen GUARD): back-walking
  never blocks. GUARD+DOWN blocks lows. Engine option
  `createMatch({ guardButton: true })` — default off, so IRON RING sims are
  bit-identical.
- **Uppercuts that launch**: every fighter's rising `dp` (→↓↑+P) sets a big
  `launch` (0.125+); the victim pops into a juggle window.
- **A signature finishing move per fighter**: `qcbf` (↓←↓→+P) at a FULL bar.
  Engine checks `qcbf` before `qcf` so its d,f tail can't be stolen. If the hit
  is clean and the victim is at/below `finishAt` (30) HP the round ends with a
  FINISH! banner + the fighter's named finisher over the top (stylized, no
  gore). CPU guards and attempts finishers through the same pad scripts.
- **Dark stages**: back alley at 2 a.m., the foundry, the last train — fog,
  procedural asphalt, chain-link, neon signs, silhouetted crowds with phone
  glow, hanging lamps with light cones, drifting embers.

## Where the code lives

- `src/engine/fighting.js` — shared core + the #1096 options (`guardButton`,
  move-level `finisher`/`finishAt`, `qcbf` motion, projectile vy/grav for
  arcing kicks). Every new line is behind a flag or a data key the IRON RING
  roster never sets.
- `src/games/ViperPit/fighters.js` — 5 fighters (NYX assassin easy, CINDER
  zoner, VESS acrobat, RIV all-round, KRAX grappler insane); each: build/gear,
  palette, stats, specials on engine motion keys + a named `finish`.
- `src/games/ViperPit/stages.js` — 3 pits (fog/light/props/neon data).
- `src/games/ViperPit/render.js` — three.js: articulated limb rigs
  (shoulder/elbow/hip/knee groups, capsule limbs), canvas-texture asphalt,
  chain-link fence, crowd + lamps + embers, hit sparks, SSIV-ish camera
  (midpoint + zoom-by-distance) with handheld shake.
- `src/games/ViperPit/index.jsx` — cabinet: attract CPU-vs-CPU demo, select,
  street ladder (NYX→KRAX easy→insane), local 2P, #1039-lobby netplay with the
  9-verb pad wire + hash-every-30, HUD canvas, FINISH flash/letterbox juice.

## Rules worth knowing

- Blocking: only `bk` (guard) blocks in this title; `blockHeld` still covers
  idle/crouch/blockstun. GUARD+DOWN = crouch-block; throws beat guard.
- Finishers spend the whole bar; they do big damage to healthy foes (dmg 20-26,
  never a reliable KO) and end a wounded one (≤30) outright via the
  `finish` event path in `resolveHit`.
- Determinism unchanged: seed + pads ⇒ identical `matchHash` (checked at
  `viperpitcheck` and via `contractcheck`).

## Controls

- P1: arrows · O or the GUARD button = block · J/Space/A punch-L · K punch-H ·
  U/B kick-L · I kick-H.
- P2 (local 2P): WASD + F/G/V/B, H guards.
- Motions: ↓→+P special (EX@50, super@100 same motion) · →↓↑+P uppercut
  (launches) · ↓←↓→+P at FULL bar FINISHING MOVE · close →+heavy THROW.
- 1 ladder · 2 local 2P · keys 3-7 quick-pick · Esc/? pause.
- Online: `/retrogames/viper-pit?net=host` / `?net=join&room=CODE`.

## Verify

- `npm run viperpitcheck` — 26 Node rule gates (guard vs back-walk, low-block,
  throw-through-guard, uppercut launch, FINISH + healthy-foe finisher, qcf not
  stolen, cancel combo, determinism, every ladder CPU completes a match) +
  headless Chrome drive (attract→select→fight, real keys reach the sim, GUARD
  hold, K.O. flow, zero page errors).
- `npm run viperpitcheck -- --mutate` — proven-fail: removing the guard gate
  must let heavies smash through GUARD.
- `CONTRACT_ONLY=viper-pit npm run contractcheck` — the #377 driving contract.
- `npm run lint:viper` + the three repo gates (`lint:mario`, `lint:fps`,
  `lint:ai`) + `npm run build`.

## Honest gaps (polish-pass candidates)

- Finishers are one big hit today; a multi-beat cinematic sequence per finisher
  would sell the signature moment.
- Uppercut launch exists but there is no dedicated juggle/aerial-combo ruleset
  yet (air recovery is the generic hitair→down).
- No intro/outround dialogue lines; win/lose quotes are QA polish.
- Sub-zero: no stage interactives or midground variety beyond props.
- `qcb` still unused by any fighter; guard crush / stun meter not implemented.
- Net select: guest pick reaches the host only if sent before the host starts.
